# Todo App (React.ts)

This project demonstrates how to use React hooks (useState), controlled components, and immutable state updates to build an interactive list application.

## Features

- Add new todos with a unique ID (crypto.randomUUID).
- Mark todos as completed (toggle with a checkbox).
- Remove todos from the list.
- Visual feedback with line-through styling for completed tasks.
- Immutable state management using array methods (map, filter, spread).
